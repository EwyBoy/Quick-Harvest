# Quick-Harvest
Adds in right-click harvesting to crops and auto replants afterwards.

# Developers
To add Quick-Harvest to your development environment you need to add the following codeblocks to your projects `build.gralde` file.  

You also need to generate a github token and add it along with your github username to your personal `gradle.properties` file in `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.gradle` or `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.
This file may not exist, and you would have to create it yourself.

Github tokens can be generated by clicking **_[here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)_**!  

Click **_Generate New Token_** and click the checkmark : **_read:packages_**.

Example of `gradle.properties` file in `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.gradle` or `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`
```groovy
//Your Github username 
gpr.username=ewyboy

//Your Github generated token with read permission checked off
gpr.token=7aa18973a4d2702de0ee6ac5e9584b03333f33a0
```
-----------------------------------
Code to add to `build.gradle`
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "QuickHarvest"
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/ewyboy/quick-harvest")
        credentials {
            username = property('gpr.username')
            password = property('gpr.token')
        }
    }
}

```
```groovy
dependencies {
    // Replace VERSION_NUMBER with the version of Quick-Harvest you want
    // Example: implementation "com.ewyboy.quickharvest:Quick-Harvest:1.16-1.1.1"
    // Builds can be found here: https://github.com/EwyBoy/Quick-Harvest/packages
    implementation "com.ewyboy.quickharvest:Quick-Harvest:VERSION_NUMBER"
}
```

## How to register a harvester

To register a harvester you will need to use the `HarvestManager`. This is like a registry for harvesters. Specifically you will need to call `HarvestManager.regsiter()`. This method takes 2 parameters, the first is your harvester and the second is an array of blocks it is effective on.

> **Note**: A Harvester is anything which implements `IHarvester`.

## Creating a custom harvester

In a typical case, when creating a custom harvester you will need to extend the class `HarvesterImpl`. This class provides you will a bunch of methods which you can use when implementing your own harvesters. The only method you must implement yourself in this case is `harvest()`. To see some examples of harvesters, take a look [here](https://github.com/EwyBoy/Quick-Harvest/tree/master/src/main/java/com/ewyboy/quickharvest/harvester).
